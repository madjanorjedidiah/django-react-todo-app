# django-react-todo-app




* We assume that you already have a django and a react environment created.

* Just place the backend in the django environment and the frontend in the react environment. With the
* backend, change the database name and password then run migrations befre running the server.

* With the frontend,just open another terminal and then start the app in the react environment.
